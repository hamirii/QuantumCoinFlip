# QuantumCoinFlip
A truly random coin flip that runs on D-Wave System's 5000Q Quantum Annealer.

quantumCoinFlip.py uses DWaveSampler() and runs directly on the QPU.

quantumCoinFlipCSP.py uses a Hybrid Sampler (Kerberos), and also uses a visualization method from utilities.py to display a 3x3 pin pad grid.

Utilities.py was taken from D-Wave's GitHub (Map Coloring Toy Example)
